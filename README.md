# Vutachat
A simple project to showcase my skills, built with Feathersjs and React.

Live demo [here](https://vutachat.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation

* I want to build a chat application for self promotion.
* I want to build a chat application to investigate Socket.io.
* I want to apply the **new React hooks** in a project to simplify coding.
* I want to apply React's **new Suspense and react-cache** for data fetching in project.
* I want to expirement with Slack webhooks.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/vutachat; npm install
    ```
3. Update your `config/default.json` accordingly.
4. Start your app

    ```

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
